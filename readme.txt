I use the Ordinary Least Squares method in different ways to find the regression line in the given datasets. 

#1 - First I use the simple slope formula to Calculate the regression line.

#2.1 and #2.2 - Then I use the OLS formula in two different ways.

#3 - And then I find the mean of the regression line obtained in the 2.1 and 2.2 method and calculate it.

#4 - Then I calculate the Sum of Squared Error (SSE) to compare the accuracy of the four methods above.

Next I upload the dataset to an online regression calculator and got the SSE for it. (Note that this part is hardcoded)

Conclusion - The method #3 gives more accurate results than method #1 and method #2. The online one (method #4) is the most accurate obviously because it is calculated by Gradient Descent.
